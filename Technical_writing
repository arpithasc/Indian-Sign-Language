üß© Overview

The AI-Powered Indian Sign Language Translator is a real time system designed to interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into text or speech. It leverages Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Speech APIs to enhance communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.


üö® Problem Statement

In India, communication barriers between hearing-impaired individuals and the rest of society are significant due to limited knowledge of ISL. There is a lack of accessible, low-cost solutions to bridge this gap in real-time.


üéØ Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Translate static and dynamic ISL gestures into readable text and spoken output.
	‚Ä¢	Enable real-time interpretation using simple webcam input.
	‚Ä¢	Make the solution scalable and affordable using open-source technologies.
