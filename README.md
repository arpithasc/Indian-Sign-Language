# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition

A deep learning-based system that translates **spoken English into Indian Sign Language gestures** using computer vision and natural language processing. Designed to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to provide an assistive technology solution by:
- Converting spoken English to text using Google Speech API
- Mapping recognized words to corresponding ISL signs
- Generating gesture animations or images to display the ISL signs

## 💡 Features

- 🎤 Speech-to-text conversion (Google Speech Recognition)
- 🧠 Keyword mapping to ISL signs
- 🖼️ Display of ISL gesture images or animations
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface
- 🤖 Optional real-time webcam gesture generation (if enabled)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – image handling and gesture display
- **Google Speech Recognition API** – convert audio to text
- **Machine Learning** (CNN/SVM if gesture generation is used)

## 🧪 Example Use Case
Say "Hello, how are you?" into the mic
The system converts it to text
Text is mapped to individual ISL signs
ISL signs are displayed sequentially

## 📚 Future Scope
Add webcam-based reverse translation (gesture to text)
Expand vocabulary using NLP
Integrate real-time animated avatars
